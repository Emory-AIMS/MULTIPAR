MULTIPAR: Supervised Irregular Tensor Factorization Framework with Multi-task Learning

By Yifei Ren, Jian Lou, Li Xiong, Joyce C. Ho, Xiaoqian Jiang and Sivasubramanium Bhavani 2021. Code for ``MULTIPAR: Supervised Irregular Tensor
Factorization Framework with Multi-task Learnings". For The IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering 2022.

Before running the codes you need to install tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org and pytorch https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to run the code.

Here is the lists of MULTIPAR files:

newweight.py: -main function of MULTIPAT, run this file.

models.py: -construct the PARAFAC2 model using EHRs.

utils.py: -util function using in MULTIPAR.
